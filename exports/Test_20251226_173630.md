## Requirements Gathering Session
Q1: # Question 1 of 8

Thank you for initiating this requirements gathering session for the **Test** project.

To begin understanding the core purpose and scope, let me ask:

**What is the primary problem or business need that this software project aims to solve, and who are the main users or stakeholders who will benefit from it?**

This will help me understand the fundamental purpose of the system and tailor my subsequent questions appropriately.
A: Q1: a marketplace for college students online

Q2: # Question 2 of 8

Thank you for that context. An online marketplace for college students is a clear direction.

**What types of products or services will students be able to buy and sell on this marketplace? For example, will it focus on textbooks and course materials, general goods (furniture, electronics), services (tutoring, ride-sharing), housing/subletting, or a combination of these categories?**

Understanding the scope of what can be traded will help define the features, safety measures, and user experience requirements needed.
A: Q2: it will do furniture and general goods

Q3: # Question 3 of 8

Great, so the marketplace will focus on furniture and general goods for college students.

**What are the critical safety and trust features you want to implement, considering students will be meeting in person or arranging pickups? For example, do you need user verification (student ID verification), rating/review systems, secure messaging, reporting mechanisms, or any specific moderation processes?**

This is particularly important for a student-focused platform to ensure safe transactions and build trust within the community.
A: Q3: student id verification, secure messaging

Q4: # Question 4 of 8

Excellent - student ID verification and secure messaging will help ensure safety and trust.

**What are your expectations for the platform's scale and performance? Specifically, how many concurrent users do you anticipate, should it serve a single campus, multiple universities, or be nationwide? And what response time or performance benchmarks are important for key actions like searching listings or sending messages?**

This will help determine the technical architecture, infrastructure requirements, and scalability considerations needed.
A: Q4: single campus to start, messages should be close to real time

Q5: # Question 5 of 8

Perfect - starting with a single campus and requiring near real-time messaging gives us clear scalability and performance targets.

**What payment or transaction model do you envision? Will payments be handled directly within the platform (requiring payment processing integration), or will students arrange payments independently (cash, Venmo, etc.)? Also, will there be any fees, commissions, or monetization strategy for the platform?**

Understanding the financial flow and business model will help define security requirements, compliance needs, and the complexity of the transaction workflow.
A: Q5: no payment for now they can arrage it independently

Q6: # Question 6 of 8

Understood - students will arrange payments independently outside the platform for now.

**What devices and platforms must the marketplace support? Should it be accessible via web browsers (desktop/mobile), native mobile apps (iOS and/or Android), or both? Are there any specific accessibility requirements or browser compatibility constraints we need to consider for the student population?**

This will help define the technical stack, development approach (responsive web, native apps, or hybrid), and ensure the platform is accessible to all students regardless of their device preferences.
A: Q6: web browser then ios after

Q7: # Question 7 of 8

Great - we'll start with a web browser version, then expand to iOS.

**What listing management capabilities do students need? Specifically, should sellers be able to upload multiple photos per listing, edit or mark items as sold, set expiration dates for listings, categorize items, add location/pickup details, and filter or search by criteria like price range, category, condition, or distance from campus?**

Understanding these features will help define the user interface, database structure, and search functionality that makes the marketplace effective and easy to use for both buyers and sellers.
A: Q7: upload multiple photos per listing, edit or mark items as sold, set expiration dates for listings, categorize items, add location/pickup details, and filter or search by criteria like price range, category, condition

Q8: # Question 8 of 8

Excellent - those listing management features will provide a comprehensive marketplace experience.

**What are your requirements for moderation, content policy enforcement, and data management? For instance, do you need admin tools to review/remove inappropriate listings, handle user reports or disputes, manage banned users, and set guidelines for what can/cannot be sold? Also, how long should listing data and user messages be retained, and are there any specific privacy or data protection concerns given that this involves student information?**

This final question addresses governance, compliance, and long-term platform management - critical for maintaining a safe, trustworthy marketplace environment for the campus community.
A: Q8: yes we will want to moderate and set guidelines. listing data and messages should be  retained for a year.
